(ns reservationops.governor
  "ReservationGovernor -- the independent compliance layer that earns
  the ReservationOpsAdvisor the right to commit. The advisor has no
  notion of whether a reservation/vendor-contract record is actually
  registered and verified, whether its own proposed `:effect` secretly
  claims a direct actuation instead of a mere proposal, or whether it
  has silently drifted into a permanently out-of-scope decision area,
  so this MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and
  fall back to HOLD.

  This actor's scope is deliberately narrow -- COORDINATION ONLY
  (booking/ticket-issuance record logging, inventory/seat-allocation
  scheduling, vendor/venue settlement coordination, payment-dispute/
  fraud/access-eligibility-concern flagging). It NEVER performs or
  authorizes:
    - directly finalizing a payment-dispute resolution
    - directly finalizing an access-eligibility override
    - any other consumer-payment or event-access authority action

  This is the Wave 4 person-facing-service safety guardrail
  (ADR-2607152500): ticketing/reservation services touch
  consumer-payment and event-access decisions, so the closed op
  allowlist NEVER includes any op that directly finalizes a
  payment-dispute resolution or an access-eligibility override -- those
  are always either a hard permanent block or an always-escalate op,
  never auto-commit-eligible.

  Three HARD checks, ALL permanent, un-overridable by any human
  approval:

    1. Reservation unverified      -- the target reservation/
                                       vendor-contract record must exist
                                       AND be independently confirmed
                                       `:registered?`/`:verified?` in
                                       the store before ANY proposal for
                                       it may commit or even escalate.
                                       Never trusts a proposal's own
                                       claim about the reservation --
                                       re-derived from the reservation's
                                       own store record, the same
                                       'ground truth, not self-report'
                                       discipline every sibling actor's
                                       governor uses.
    2. Effect not :propose         -- every proposal's `:effect` MUST
                                       be `:propose`. Any other effect
                                       value is, by construction, a
                                       claim to directly actuate/commit
                                       outside governance -- HARD block,
                                       not merely low-confidence.
    3. Scope exclusion             -- ANY proposal (regardless of op)
                                       whose op is outside the closed
                                       four-op allowlist, or whose
                                       rationale, summary, citations or
                                       draft value touches directly
                                       finalizing a payment-dispute
                                       resolution or directly finalizing
                                       an access-eligibility override,
                                       is a HARD, PERMANENT block --
                                       this actor's charter excludes
                                       that territory structurally, not
                                       as a rollout milestone. Evaluated
                                       UNCONDITIONALLY on every
                                       proposal. An op outside the
                                       closed four-op allowlist is the
                                       SAME failure mode (an advisor
                                       proposing something it was never
                                       authorized to propose) and is
                                       folded into this same check.

  One ESCALATE (SOFT) gate: LLM confidence below the floor, OR the op
  is `:flag-transaction-concern` (ALWAYS escalates to a human,
  regardless of confidence, regardless of how clean the proposal
  otherwise is), OR a `:coordinate-vendor-settlement` proposal whose
  estimated settlement amount exceeds `high-value-threshold`.
  `reservationops.phase` independently agrees: `:flag-transaction-concern`
  is never a member of any phase's `:auto` set either -- two layers,
  not one."
