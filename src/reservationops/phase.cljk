  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-7990 (Other reservation
  service and related activities) operations-coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only            -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging     -- reservation-record logging
                                      allowed, every write needs human
                                      approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination-- adds allocation-operation
                                      scheduling and vendor-settlement
                                      coordination, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto      -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                      `:log-reservation-record`/
                                      `:schedule-allocation-operation`/
                                      `:coordinate-vendor-settlement`
                                      may auto-commit.
                                      `:flag-transaction-concern` NEVER
                                      auto-commits, at any phase.

  `:flag-transaction-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come (Wave 4 person-facing-service safety
  guardrail, ADR-2607152500). Flagging a payment-dispute/fraud/
  access-eligibility concern always needs a human to actually look at
  it. `reservationops.governor`'s own `always-escalate-ops` enforces
  the same invariant independently -- two layers, not one, agree on
  this."
